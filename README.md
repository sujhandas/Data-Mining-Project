Portugal is famous for several thingsincluding seafood, beaches, and soccer legends, but is known globally in the culinary world for Port wine from the Douro Valley region. However, Portugal has vineyards across most of the countryside, and produces a vast variety of wines from the sweet, fortified Port to lightbodied Bucelas, and the fruit-driven Tinto Beira. With 31 distinct “Denominação de Origem Controlada,” also called a DOC or Controlled Denomination of Origin, Portugal has the infrastructure to be a wineproducing powerhouse. Why then is the country not as renowned for its wine as countries such as France, Spain, or Italy? 

According to winefolly.com, each DOC means “the wine comes from a strictly defined geographical area with recommended and permitted grapes and maximum wine yields to control quality", much like the Champagne region of France. This analysis will take an in-depth study of how Portugal can increase market shares of the global wine market by using predictors to determine what attributes generally make a wine rated higher, as well as a decision tree and forest to predict the rating of a wine based on the different attributes of the wine. The wine that will be used is specifically the red and white variants of the Vinho Verde wine, a wine from the Minho region of Portugal, in the northwest of the country.
